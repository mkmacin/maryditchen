# My.IllinoisState.edu

For My.IllinoisState I served as the primary front end designer, working collaboratively with the dev team, other designers, & our accessibility coordinator to build out a series of highly usable/accessible interactive dashboards, widgets, & modules for a modern & complex intranet built using Vue.js & Fortune (Opulence PHP). My work included building out document structures using semantic HTML & writing standards-compliant, BEM-notated Sass that employed modern CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox).

The <a href="/project-work/my-illinoisstate-edu/midterm-grades/">Midterm Grades</a> and <a href="/project-work/my-illinoisstate-edu/budget-center/">Budget Center</a> modules are excellent examples of my ability to produce highly inclusive, standards-compliant front-end interfaces using Vue JS and Fortune PHP to dynamically render rich, interactive web content for various user groups (faculty, students, administrative staff). Though relatively new to both Vue and Fortune, I was able to review the available documentation for each to suss out the front-end functionality I required with limited intervention from the project's web developers, allowing them to focus on backend integrations and infrastructure. Among other things, I became adept at building out template elements, writing directives to conditionally render content, and using interpolation to inject dynamic content onto the page.
