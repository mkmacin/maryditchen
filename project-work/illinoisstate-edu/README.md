# IllinoisState.edu
---
For the IllinoisState.edu project, my most significant contributions were to document structure, semantics, and accessibility.

I conducted an extensive review of the document structure for all "hub" pages, wrote best practice-based recommendations for a more semantic document structure, & worked closely with the accessibility coordinator to improve the overall UX for assistive technology users. My work contributed to a significantly more robust product because of the modern & inclusive document structure I helped inform & build.
